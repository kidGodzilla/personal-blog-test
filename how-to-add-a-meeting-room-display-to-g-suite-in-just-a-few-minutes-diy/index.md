## Mount any tablet or iPad outside your conference rooms as a meeting room display, and keep your space organized

![Put together a display, just like this one, in about 5 minutes.](./asset-1.png)

### What you’ll need:

1.  A **small tablet** with a web browser and an internet connection. At least 8" is recommended. **Android**, **iOS**, and **Windows** will work great.
2.  **Mounting hardware**. There are tons of options here. Search Amazon for the mounting hardware that makes the most sense to you, ranging from $3 for 3M velcro mounting adhesive strips, or $100 for a secure, aluminum designer mount (Hekler Design).
3.  **Extra-long power cord & Power adapter**. Self-explanatory. You’re going to need a reliable power adapter, and an extra-long power cable that reaches your desired mounting location. We also recommend picking up some **zip ties** or **3M adhesive strips** if you’re worried about dangling cables.
4.  **G Suite Administrator Credentials**
5.  A free **Meeting Room 365** account.

### Create a free MeetingRoom365 Account

Sign up for a Free [**MeetingRoom365**](https://www.meetingroom365.com/) account. This will allow you to create and deploy unlimited, customizable meeting room displays. Pay when you’re ready (each display is free for 30 days, then it’s $5/month per display. Annual discounts available). [View Demo](https://meetingroom365.com/display/?key=56dce6f42e83d#demo).

![Once you sign up, you’ll get a simple admin panel to manage and provision meeting room displays](./asset-2.png)

### Configure G Suite

This [**Article from Google**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1686462?hl=en)  explains what a **Resource Calendar** is in **G Suite**, and how to set one up for your organization. You’ll need a **Resource Mailbox Calendar** for each display you wish to create. Once you set one up, it’ll appear in **Google Calendar** as a **Room**, that your entire organization will be able to see.

#### This article that we’ve recently created is, hopefully, a much simpler and easier-to-understand guide for setting up Resources in G Suite:

[**Adding a Meeting Room Resource to G Suite**  
_A Simplified Guide to adding a Meeting Room Resource Calendar and Mailbox to G Suite_medium.com](https://medium.com/meeting-room-365/adding-a-meeting-room-resource-to-g-suite-c389831122aa "https://medium.com/meeting-room-365/adding-a-meeting-room-resource-to-g-suite-c389831122aa")[](https://medium.com/meeting-room-365/adding-a-meeting-room-resource-to-g-suite-c389831122aa)

### Logging into Meeting Room 365 (Admin Portal)

Once you create an account, you can log into your Meeting Room 365 Admin portal from any computer to manage the displays associated with your Office 365 Tenant. Simply visit: [**https://beta.meetingroom365.com/**](https://beta.meetingroom365.com/) **to view your Admin portal or manage display configuration**.

### View your Existing Displays

From the Meeting Room 365 Admin Portal, you’ll see a list of existing displays linked to your tenant domain and/or account.

### Add a New Display

When you are ready to add a new display, just click the large, **Plus button** in the bottom right corner.

![Click the plus button to add a new display to your account.](./asset-4.png)

#### Next, select the appropriate display type.

**Note:** If you select Exchange, you will be directed to our Legacy platform. Our new platform is not currently set up to support Exchange.

#### Complete the Wizard Steps

Next, you’ll be guided through a short setup process to provision your mailbox in **G Suite** or **Office 365**. Complete these steps, if you have not done so already.

![A short wizard will guide you through the setup process.](./asset-6.png)

#### Provide your Meeting Room Resource Email address and choose a Display Name

You will be asked to provide the resource mailbox email address, and choose a name for your meeting room. This can be updated later.

![](./asset-7.png)

**Note:** A resource mailbox is a specialized mailbox in G Suite. You should not use a normal user and mailbox calendar for Meeting Room displays.

Also, in **G Suite**, a Resource Mailbox email address will always end in **@resource.calendar.google.com** (this is our #1 support question for **G Suite**).

#### Copy your Display Key

You’ll need this to complete tablet provisioning

#### Install the Meeting Room 365 app and provision your tablet

![Native apps are currently available in the above three App stores](./asset-9.png)

Native apps are currently available in the **iTunes App Store**, **Amazon App Store**, and **Google Play Store.** Download the app to your device to get started.

![Here’s what you should see when you open the app for the first time.](./asset-10.png)

**Here is a full guide to setting up your display:**

#### Set up recurring payment (optional)

Next, you are given a prompt to set up recurring payment, for the convenience of existing users adding an additional tablet. However, new users are able to evaluate each display they set up for 30 days. Reach out if you have any questions!
