Meeting rooms have become essential in the work environment; having one in your office is necessary for the excellent development of your business. Every company needs an adequate and ready space to have meetings, that is why a meeting room is perfect for developing new projects, holding meetings with your work team, receiving your clients, among many other reasons.

Through this guide which will give you the simple steps to carry out the installation of the room at an affordable cost and in a simplified manner.

#### **In conference rooms, attendees need:**

-   Easy to use technology.
-   Ability to start meetings on time.
-   High-quality audio and video that enables collaboration rather than a distraction.

#### **IT teams need a technology partner that can offer them:**

-   Systems that are easy to acquire, implement and use.
-   Scalable and interoperable video solutions.
-   Lower total cost of ownership and more efficient return on investment.

Everything you need to set up the installation of a conference room can be found in the following steps:

A small tablet with a web browser and an Internet connection, at least 6" screen with Android, iOS, FireOS, or Windows operating systems, that will provide good performance. Some great choices include: [Amazon Fire Tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/b?ie=UTF8&node=6669703011), [Android Tablets](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=+android+tablets) and the [Apple iPad Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-ME276LL-Wi-Fi-Black-Space/dp/B00GNKRFEA).

You will also need mounting accessories, and there are many options on Amazon for mounting hardware to suit your needs, ranging from $3 for [3M mounting adhesive strips](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=3M+mounting+adhesive+strips), or $149+ for a secure, aluminum designer tablet mount, such as [Heckler Design’s Windfall series](https://hecklerdesign.com/tablet-enclosures/?form_factor=12).

Finally, you need a power cord and a power adapter that is long enough to reach from your power source to the device. You may also need to to use 3M adhesive strips or Zip Ties to hang some cables.

Some locations may have access to an Ethernet Jack, but not a Power Outlet. [Power over Ethernet (PoE)](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=power+over+ethernet) hardware can power many small tablets, and you can even hide the adapter underneath your enclosure.

In some cases, it may not be feasible to bring power directly to your devices. In this case, you may want to consider [Rechargeable Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/0553E8AE-45B3-45D6-95B3-78244DB98268) (often, these can last up to a week on a single charge).

#### **Equipment**

The first and most fundamental advantage is that a meeting room is fully equipped to receive your attendees. In the first instance, it has the right furniture to attend to your clients, suppliers or work team. What a boardroom must have to have to be fully equipped is the following:

-   A screen to share presentations
-   A whiteboard or other space to write
-   Connections, converters, and adapters for all operating systems & equipment
-   High-speed Internet
-   Technical support

#### **Image, functionality, and formality**

The meeting rooms are designed to make your meetings functional and formal so that the image of your company will generate greater satisfaction in the eyes of the public. Having the right space and the right equipment will ensure that your clients are well received and that your meetings, being highly practical, functional and formal, have more potential to be successful. All this can be achieved with a simple installation and a precise follow-up of the indications mentioned above.
